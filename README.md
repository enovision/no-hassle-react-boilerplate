# No hassle React Boilerplate No hassle ReactJS Boilerplate with **Webpack** and **Redux** is an easy to implement React Boilerplate. It has been composed because I felt that it should be easy to implement and still looks transparant and flexible in case that further tweaking is required. It has nomore pretention than that the user can start as quickly as possible with developing great React app, once he has installedthis repository as described below.#### Benefits* easy installation* no hard to comprehend scripts and configs* clear application structure* preformatted, highly compressed production build available* includes **Webpack**, **Redux**, **Babel** and **Karma*** supports `jsx` transformation out of the box* good starting point for tweaking and extending to your own needsThis boilerplate contains for example **Webpack**, **Babel** and **Redux**.### Easy startAfter installing this boilerplate you have an application ready environment, that is easy to use and has a clear structure. It contains starters for running a server with `npm start` and to build a highly optimized production build with `npm run build`. Furthermore the `serve` package have been included to see your production build working with `npm run production`. ## InstallationTo install this boilerplate you clone this repository to your project folder ```git clone https://github.com/enovision/no-hassle-react-boilerplate.git <your-project-name>```then run in folder `x:\<your-project-name>`:```npm install``` The node_modules will be installed and after that is finished you can start the application with:```npm start```## Package.json```{  "name": "no-hassle-react-boilerplate",  "version": "0.0.1",  "description": "React Boilerplate that is easy to install with a lot of features",  "main": "index.js",  "dependencies": {    "babel-polyfill": "^6.23.0",    "bootstrap": "^3.3.7",    "html-webpack-plugin": "^2.28.0",    "modernizr-webpack-plugin": "^1.0.5",    "postcss-cssnext": "^2.11.0",    "postcss-import": "^10.0.0",    "promise": "^7.1.1",    "react": "^15.5.4",    "react-addons-transition-group": "^15.5.2",    "react-bootstrap": "^0.31.0",    "react-dom": "^15.5.4",    "react-fontawesome": "^1.6.1",    "react-redux": "^5.0.5",    "react-router": "^4.1.1",    "react-transform": "0.0.3",    "react-transition-group": "^1.1.3",    "redux": "^3.6.0",    "rimraf": "^2.6.1",    "serve": "^5.1.5",    "webpack": "^2.5.1",    "webpack-hot-middleware": "^2.18.0",    "webpack-merge": "^4.1.0"  },  "devDependencies": {    "autoprefixer": "^7.1.1",    "babel-core": "^6.24.1",    "babel-loader": "^7.0.0",    "babel-plugin-react-transform": "^2.0.2",    "babel-preset-es2015": "^6.24.1",    "babel-preset-react": "^6.24.1",    "babel-preset-react-optimize": "^1.0.1",    "chai": "^3.5.0",    "copy-webpack-plugin": "^4.0.1",    "css-loader": "^0.28.1",    "expect": "^1.20.2",    "extract-text-webpack-plugin": "^2.1.0",    "file-loader": "^0.11.1",    "html-webpack-plugin": "^2.28.0",    "image-webpack-loader": "^3.3.1",    "istanbul-instrumenter-loader": "^2.0.0",    "istanbul-react": "^1.1.0",    "jasmine": "^2.6.0",    "json-loader": "^0.5.4",    "jsx-loader": "^0.13.2",    "karma": "^1.7.0",    "karma-chai": "^0.1.0",    "karma-chrome-launcher": "^2.1.1",    "karma-cli": "^1.0.1",    "karma-coverage": "^1.1.1",    "karma-jasmine": "^1.1.0",    "karma-mocha": "^1.3.0",    "karma-mocha-reporter": "^2.2.3",    "karma-phantomjs-launcher": "^1.0.4",    "karma-react-jsx-preprocessor": "^0.1.1",    "karma-remap-istanbul": "^0.6.0",    "karma-sourcemap-loader": "^0.3.7",    "karma-webpack": "^2.0.3",    "less": "^2.7.2",    "less-loader": "^4.0.3",    "mocha": "^3.4.1",    "mocha-loader": "^1.1.1",    "node-sass": "^4.5.3",    "postcss-loader": "^2.0.5",    "promise": "^7.1.1",    "react-fetch": "0.0.9",    "react-hot-loader": "^1.3.1",    "react-transform-hmr": "^1.0.4",    "redux-devtools": "^3.4.0",    "sass-loader": "^6.0.5",    "style-loader": "^0.17.0",    "webpack-dev-server": "^2.4.5"  },  "scripts": {    "start": "webpack-dev-server --config webpack.config.js --hot --inline --port 8080",    "build": "rimraf build && webpack --config ./config/webpack/webpack.prod.js --progress --profile --colors",    "production": "serve -s ./build/production",    "test": "karma start ./config/karma/karma.config.js"  },  "author": "J.J. van de Merwe, Enovision GmbH",  "license": "MIT"}```By default the `npm start` is using port *8080*. If you need to use another port, you can modifythis to another value.The script `npm run production` is using the `serve` package with its default values. ``` ┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────┐ │                                                  │ │   Serving!                                       │ │                                                  │ │   - Local:            http://localhost:5000      │ │   - On Your Network:  http://192.168.10.1:5000   │ │                                                  │ │   Copied local address to clipboard!             │ │                                                  │ └──────────────────────────────────────────────────┘```## ConfigThe `config` files for `webpack` and `postcss` have been put in a separate folder `config`. In the `config\webpack` folder you will find:* webpack.common.js - _options that are shared in `dev` and `prod`_* webpack.dev.js - _configuration for the testing environment_* webpack.prod.js - _configuration for the production build_It is using the `webpack-merge` package to merge the configuration, where the `common` configuration is always applied (extended)  with the needed `dev` or `prod` settings.## Application structureThe intention of the boilerplate is to keep things simple. Therefor the application structure is kept simple to understand:```|-- <app root folder>    |-- .babelrc    |-- main.jsx    |-- package.json    |-- webpack.config.js    |-- app        |-- settings        |   |-- appSettings.jsx        |-- app.jsx        |-- calculator.jsx        |-- greetings.jsx    |-- build    |   |-- production    |-- config    |   |-- settings    |   |-- postcss    |   |-- webpack    |-- public        |-- index.html        |-- assets            |-- css            |-- fonts            |-- images            |-- sass    |-- tests        |-- _allTests.js        |-- calculator-test.js    ```### .babelrcThe configuration settings for `Babel`###  main.jsxThe entry javascript file for your application.```import React from 'react';import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';import './public/assets/css/styles.css';import App from './app/app';ReactDOM.render(    <App />, document.getElementById('App'));```### package.jsonThe configuration settings for this project### webpack.config.jsThis file imports the webpack settings for the `dev` environment. The config settings itself should be modified in the particular files in `config\webpack`.### appHere you put the code of your components that has to become your wonderful new application. * app.jsx, _welcome page_* calculator.jsx, _Script to check if Karma (testing) is working._* greetings.jsx, _Additional script to support the welcome page_All the above scripts can be deleted at your own will.### build\productionThis where the `npm run build` is saving the output from the compilation. The `css` and other assets are not included in `bundle.js` build. If you don't like thisyou have to modify the `webpack.prod.js` in the `config\webpack` folder to your own demand.### config#### config/postcssConfiguration files for the `postcss` plugin#### config/webpackConfiguration files for webpack:* webpack.common.js, _shared configs for both `dev` and `production`_* webpack.dev.js, _configuration for the `devevelopment` build_* webpack.prod.js, _configuration for the `production` build_When the build is started, depending on the requested function it will merge the `common`settings with the settings from the selected build.### publicIn this folder you put everything that you want to include in the final build. The complete contents will copied to your final build. Except `index.html`, which will be buildby `webpack` at the moment of creating the build. **Important!**The `index.html` in this folder should not be removed !!!This file is used by `webpack` as the template file to generate the final index.html with the properassignments. You may modify the file, as long as the following attributes stay in tact:```<body>   <div id="App"></div></body>```When this is not there, your `react` application will not render properly.## Package references and documentation### Selection of packagesThe selection of chosen packages could be arbitrary to some, but besides the support for **Webpack**, **Babel** and **Redux**, I have included some packages that you might or mightnot use.The following packages have been included because they represent popular frameworks or support tasks often used in apps.* **FontAwesome** support, most popular freely usable font icon [icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) * **Bootstrap**, very popular but you could also have your own favorite, which you have to install by yourself* **SASS** support, most popular CSS scripting language* **LESS** support, almost as popular as SASS (I hope :-))* **Fetch** for Ajax support, was chosen because I becomes more and more the standard choice  * alternatives: [link](https://hashnode.com/post/5-best-libraries-for-making-ajax-calls-in-react-cis8x5f7k0jl7th53z68s41k1)* **Promises**, because of its usage in combination with _Fetch_ [link](https://www.eventbrite.com/engineering/learning-es6-promises/)* **Karma**, because it used quite a lot as the package for testing the application##### IMPORTANT: jQuery is not included! #####To include jQuery in your own build, you could modify the `index.html` in the `public` folder and addthe `<script>` references yourself. [Wrapping jQuery with React.](https://teamgaslight.com/blog/wrapping-jquery-with-react)  > It is highly recommended to read the documentation that comes with packages, you can find the   links to the documentation in the table below  ### Remark to Bootstrap and FontAwesomeThere are many other frameworks and font managers to choose from. In this repository I have selected `react-bootstrap` and`react-fontawesome`. These packages require that you have the required CSS added to your index.html seperate from the builditself.    ### Testing the application ###For testing the application the `Karma` package is included. You can find a good read on howto test your application with _Karma_ and _React_ [here](https://www.toptal.com/react/how-react-components-make-ui-testing-easy).   You'll find in the `app` folder a script called `calculator.jsx`. This can be removed at your own will. This script is used in the `calculator-test.js` script in the `tests` folder in the root of the application. All tests can be put in this folder and should end with `-test.js`.You can see if your tests run succesfully by entering:```npm run test```Although a lot of testing packages are includes in this repository, I have included `Karma` with `jasmine` as framework and`mocha` as reporter in the test. You can find the configuration in `config\karma\karma.config.js`. ### Package Documentation##### All, but testing related|Package | Description ||---|---||[autoprefixer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/autoprefixer)|PostCSS plugin to parse CSS and add vendor prefixes to CSS rules   ||[babel-core](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-core)|Babel compiler core   ||[babel-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-loader)|This package allows transpiling JavaScript files using Babel and webpack.   ||[babel-plugin-react-transform](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-react-transform)|This plugin wraps React components with arbitrary transforms. ||[babel-preset-es2015](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-es2015)|Babel preset for all es2015 plugins.   ||[babel-preset-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-react)| Babel preset for all React plugins.  ||[babel-preset-react-optimize](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-react-optimize)|   ||[copy-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/copy-webpack-plugin)|Copy files and directories in webpack   ||[css-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/css-loader)|The css-loader interprets @import and url() like import/require() and will resolve them.   ||[extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/extract-text-webpack-plugin)|Extract text from bundle into a file.   ||[file-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/file-loader)|File loader for webpack   ||[html-webpack-plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-webpack-plugin)|This is a webpack plugin that simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles.   ||[image-webpack-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/image-webpack-loader)|Image loader module for webpack   ||[json-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-loader)|JSON loader for webpack   ||[less](https://www.npmjs.com/package/less)|This is the JavaScript, official, stable version of Less.   ||[less-loader](https://www.npmjs.com/package/less-loader)|Less loader for webpack.

This folder contains only a singlescript called `appSettings.js`. It is used for the very rudimentary application that comes withthe installation of this package.The script contains a singleton that reads a JSON that can befound in the file `config/settings.json`. You can put all kinds to data there that you might use in yourapplication, but is not strictly required for a single component.I like this kind of approach, because you have global settings not in your application, but in the`config` folder of your application, which make maintaining without rebuilding your application somewhat easier.Sample JSON```{  "credits": "Thank you so much",  "copyLeft": "2017 Enovision GmbH",  "license": "MIT"}```Sample use```import {AppSettings} from './settings/appSettings';class SettingsSample extends extends React.Component        constructor (props) {        super(props);                console.log('AppSettings.getCredits());        console.log('AppSettings.getCopyLeft());        console.log('AppSettings.getLicense());    }        render () {        return (            <div className="container">                <div>                    <Row>                        <Col md={12}>                            <Greeting                                name={AppSettings.getCredits()}                                url={AppSettings.getUrl()}                            />                        </Col>                    </Row>                    <Row>                        <Col md={12}}                            {AppSettings.getLicense()}                            <FontAwesome name='copyright' style={{                                paddingRight: 5, paddingLeft: 5                            }}/>                            {AppSettings.getCopyLeft()}                        </Col>                    </Row>                </div>            </div>        );    }    ...}```AppSettings converts every JSON property to a function starting with `get` followed by the first character capitalized from the property name in the JSON._You can delete it if you don't use it._## Have questions or suggestions?Use the issues tab in this repository. ##CreditsThe amazing GRAV CMS Team for building such an amazing CMS.
