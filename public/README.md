# Don't delete the `index.html` file!

Minimal requirements:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8"/>
    <title>Some title</title>
<body>
<div id="App"></div>
</body>
</html>
```

You can modify the `<head>` entries but you have to keep the `<body>` like
it is in the template above!
